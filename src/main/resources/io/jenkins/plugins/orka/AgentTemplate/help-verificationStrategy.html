  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Default Verification Strategy</b>: Ð¢his strategy relies on three verification instruments: VPN, user authentication, and SSH. 
      All traffic between Jenkins and the Orka environment is secured and encrypted through the dedicated password-protected VPN. 
      Jenkins authenticates and performs operations against the cluster with a dedicated Orka user. 
      Jenkins connects to the VM via SSH and authenticates with VM-specific credentials. 
      The traffic between Jenkins and the VM is further encrypted via SSH.
      The Default Verification Strategy does not require additional setup.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>AES Verification Strategy</b>: This strategy adds a fourth verification instrument to the default strategy. 
      Before running any jobs on a VM, Jenkins further verifies its identity through the exchange and symmetric encryption/decryption of a randomly generated string. 
      Note: This strategy does not provide additional encryption for the traffic between Jenkins and the VM.
      To enable AES Verification Strategy and complete its setup, contact MacStadium support.
