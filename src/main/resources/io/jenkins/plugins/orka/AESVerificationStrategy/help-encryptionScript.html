  The script that encrypts the randomly-generated verification string with the symmetric AES key available to the VM. 
  Jenkins automatically creates and passes the randomly-generated verification string as the first argument of this script.
  This script runs on the VM. Jenkins picks up the script output and decrypts it with its copy of the symmetric AES key. 
  For more information about how to configure the key and implement the encryption script, contact MacStadium support.
