<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Use agent only once</b>: Run a single job on the agent. The agent is terminated when the job completes.
      Use this option if you want to have a new agent for every build job.
      In case of an unexpected failure, the agent will terminate automatically when the specified idle time expires.
      The number of executors must be 1 if you use this strategy.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Keep until idle time expires</b>: Run multiple jobs on the agent. The agent is terminated when the specified idle time expires.
      Use this option if you want to reuse the agent instead of creating a new one for each job.
    </li>
  </ul>
